# The Sorting Hat

The Sorting Hat is based on the Harry Potter sorting hat where an Instagram user is sorted into a particular Hogwarts house based on their Instagram images. It was created using Python and Flask with some HTML and CSS for the front-end.

This application was created for the Clarifai Bounties Challenge and uses the Clarifai API to recognize images in the user's Instagram feed.
